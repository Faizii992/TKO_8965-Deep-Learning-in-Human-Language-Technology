        "- **Description of the chosen corpus:** Hugging Face's \"mteb/amazon_reviews_multi\" dataset is a collection of reviews of various Amazon products in different languages.\n",
        "The reviews in this dataset were most likely gathered from the extensive platform of Amazon, which offers reviews for a broad variety of products in several languages.\n",
        "\n",
        "- According to the word \"Multi\" in the dataset name, it contains reviews written in many languages. For cross-lingual NLP jobs, this can be helpful. This corpus contains 1.26M rows of  German, English, Spanish, French, Japanese and Chinese. All languages consist of 210K rows. The attributes include id(string), text(string), label(int32), label_text(string). It contains sers of Train:1.2M, validation:30K, test:30K. Normally the id consists of two letters from the language followed by an id which uniquely identifies each row. And the label consists of values from 0 to 4 in which the review gradually improves with the value, 0 being the lowest and worst possible review while 4 being the highest.\n",
        "\n",
        "There can be a limit of 20 reviews per reviewer and a maximum of 20 reviews per product. Every review is at least 20 characters long and is terminated after 2,000 characters.\n",
        "A review's language may differ from the language used in its marketplace (for example, reviews on amazon.de are mostly written in German, but they may also be written in English, etc.). To ascertain the language of the review text, the authors of this corpora thus used a language detection algorithm and eliminated reviews that were not written in the anticipated language.\n",

        "- **Usage**: This dataset may be used for testing and training models for tasks like sentiment analysis, language modeling, and translation by academics and data scientists.

        " - In the original paper, for training and testing both in English, the accuracy is 59.1% whereas for our model, the accuracy for the best combination of hyperparameters is 58.7%. Even though it did not surpass the model, it yielded a performance very close to the actual even after being trained on the best possible combination of parameters for running in Google Colab.\n",
        " - For the Cross Lingual experiment, the training loss is 6.7% & loss on the test set is 8.03%. For the baseline, the test loss was 1.62% which is much less. The conclusion could be that, while cross lingual is effective for capturing a lot of information about other languages even after being trained on a particular language, with limited data and training resources, it performed a could enough job. The situation could be improved with better hyperparameters(training for more epochs and more train and validation batch sizes) and by using more data for the base language(french in this case). Since only 1000 french sentences were used, they managed to instill knowledge for finding the correct labels for quite some English sentences and the overall performance is noteworthy.\n",
        "\n",
        " - For the Multi Lingual experiment, test loss was 7.4% respectively. For the main/baseline experimnent(trained and tested on English only), it was 1.62%. The performance most likely degraded due to the limited amount of french and english datasets chosen finally since after randomly taking both english and french datasets, we finalized on just 1000 samples. So one reason for performance degradation could be that the model could not capture enough variation in the data when it was trained on both datasets at once due to limited data available. For the paper,\n",

        "- For the paper's model model, the the training loss for model trained on English was 6.25% and when tested on French Dataset it was 47.1%. That was opposite to our training and testing scenario.\n",

        "- For simplicity and ease of experiments in this platform, the number of epochs have also been kept very minimal for all 3 experiments."
